# Rubyhu

Rubyhu watches what you do and takes notes. But in ruby. 
I like python, but I like ruby more. I also like [scottjacksonx](https://github.com/scottjacksonx)'s [hu project](https://github.com/scottjacksonx/hu), so I decided to rewrite it in ruby and make it available to everyone. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rubyhu'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rubyhu

## Usage

Running `rubyhu snap` will get you started. More on that later.
